Huippis Herding is a game I made in a two person team for Reaktor Gamejam in 48 hours. In this game, your mission is to make your team of “Huippis” attend various fun events at Reaktor sauna floor. Equipped with beer to attract them and “Party Mocca“ to repel them, you herd them around a bit like a herd of sheep.

For a long time, I’ve wanted to do a game about herding with flocking behavior. Here I had the chance to try out that concept. Unfortunately flocking seems to work better for enemies than for friendly characters you’re trying to control. The end result was a bit hard to understand initially, but we had some score competition going on with players who got it.
