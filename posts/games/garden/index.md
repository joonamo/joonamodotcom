In Conway's Garden Life your plants live or die by the classic rules of Conway's Game of Life. Plant your seeds and see them flourish (or die)! Do you think you're the best gardener around? Prove it in the leaderboards or check the replays of the best gardens.

The game works in both desktop and mobile browsers, so you can make the best garden in the world, anywhere in the world.
