Stormdivers is an unpublished online multiplayer game from Housemarque. I worked as gameplay engineer in this game during the early development of the project for about one year. My responsibilities included for example player character skills and movement, game events and online systems. We were quite small team in the early stages of the project, so I worked in almost all parts of the game. During my time, we got the project as far as having first closed online user tests underway.
