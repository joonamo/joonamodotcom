A browser game created for Ludum Dare 46 game jam. In the game you plant flowers in your garden and the flowers live and die according to the rules of Conway's game of life.

The game runs in browser with React, MobX and Bulma technologies. The game has persistent leaderboards with my [Highscore Server](/web/highscore). Since the game is fully deterministic, I managed to record a replay with every score entry. Players are able to check the highest scoring games and learn from them. According to comments on the jam page, people found this feature interesting and I hope it allowed players to learn from each other. Unfortunately, the game was a bit too difficult for some people.

## Description from the Ludum Dare Page

In Conway's Garden Life your plants live or die by the classic rules of Conway's Game of Life. Plant your seeds and see them flourish (or die)! Do you think you're the best gardener around? Prove it in the leaderboards or check the replays of the best gardens.

The game works in both desktop and mobile browsers, so you can make the best garden in the world, anywhere in the world.
