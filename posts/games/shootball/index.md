# Shootball!

2017

A game made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 41 game jam.

You are the only player in your football team against the endless legion of the enemy team. Your only chance to win is to use your speed and your 360 LASER! Kick the balls to the goal more times than your opponent before the time runs out to win, that’s the only rule in football! Your goals extend time by 5 seconds, enemy goal reduce time 5 seconds.

Tested to work on latest Firefox (Windows/Mac), Chrome (Windows/Mac), Vivaldi (Mac). Controllers also work on all but Mac Firefox.
