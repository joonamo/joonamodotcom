Alienation is a top-down action game by Housemarque released for PlayStation 4. Alienation features explosive action with tons of enemies on screen at once with up to four player online and offline multiplayer.

I worked as a Gameplay Programmer in Alienation. My main responsibilities were scripting the player characters, enemy AI and their network syncing system. The gameplay script was mostly written in Housemarque's in-house scripting language and state-machine tool Stated. I worked closely with the art, animation and design teams to help with their needs. I gave a speech about the tools and workflows used in Alienation at Assembly 2016, the recording is embedded below.
