An Unity game created for Ludum Dare 46 game jam. In the game you play as a rider struggling to stay on their horse. We created this game with a small team. My responsibility was code, animations and most of the design.

The game was my first "real" Unity 2D game. Previously all my 2D Unity games have been 3D games with orthographic camera. For this game we wanted to have exact 2D physics and physics-based animations. I created all the animations with Unity joints, springs and a little bit of code. I was quite happy how the animations turned out.

The game was quite succesful: We achived place 32 / 2204 in FUN category and 52 / 2204 in the OVERALL category of the Jam. I implemented support for online leaderboards with my [Highscore server](/web/highscore) and some people got really competitive. The highest score was 1111 when second best was 305. I was personally able to achieve only 35 points and expected nobody to actulla break 100 point limit since the game was quite difficult.

All animations are done in Unity 2D physics with tiny amount of code and lots of hinges and springs. No horses were harmed while making this game.

The leaderboard service is slightly updated version of my old [Highscore server](/web/highscore) created for my [Ludum Dare 46 game](/games/garden). Web leaderboards [also available](https://unstables.joonamo.com/scores/)!
