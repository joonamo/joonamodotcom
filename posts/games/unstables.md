All animations are done in Unity 2D physics with tiny amount of code and lots of hinges and springs. No horses were harmed while making this game.

The leaderboard service is slightly updated version of my old Highscore server created for my [Ludum Dare 46 game](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/conways-garden-life). Web leaderboards [also available](https://unstables.joonamo.com/scores/)!
