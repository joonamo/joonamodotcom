Robotron 2084 is one of my all-time favourite arcade games. This 3d-printed miniature cabinet features the game in fully playable form with 4-way twin-sticks, 2 buttons (enter and esc) and a 1.8" lcd screen connected to SPI. The game is emulated in AdvanceMame and runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero. I designed the cabinet in Autodesk Fusion 360 and had it printed at Shapeways.

I'm very happy on how the cabinet looks and the game is fully playable. It is amazing to see the full Robotron game running on a Nendoroid-sized machine. I'm still planning to remake this project some day, since there are some issues with the design.Â The 4-way sticks I used are pretty stiff, using similar components as console controllers would make the game more enjoyable. The cabinet doesn't fit a speaker and the display has slightly lower resolution than the game, so the text is quite blurry. But all things considered, i'm quite happy how this project turned out.
